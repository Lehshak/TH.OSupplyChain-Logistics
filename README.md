# TH.OSupplyChain-Logistics
This is our project for the TH.0 hackathon,  takes in ship coordinates, schedules and speeds in order to find a way to maximize the fuel efficiency while arriving on destination exactly on the right time(to stop port pollution).
We have created a program that takes in ship coordinates, schedules and speeds in order to find a way to maximize the fuel efficiency while arriving
on destination exactly on the right time. By finding the latitude and longitude of both the ships and the port the program can calculate the difference
between them in kilometers. Next, the program uses an algorithm by utilizing the values of the shipsâ€™ maximum, minimum, and most efficient speeds(for slow steaming)
to figure out the amount of time the ship should spend in the most efficient speed and also when the ship should either slow down or speed up. In order to keep the 
ship on sea and reducing emissions at the same time.
